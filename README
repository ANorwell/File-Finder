ABOUT

This is a ruby implementation of a subset of UNIX find's
functionality. It supports exact file matching, full-path regex
matching,  and file creation time tests.

Multiple file filters are supported at once, and each must be true for
a file to be found. For example:

ruby ./find.rb ./ name foo AND ctime_min 0.1

Would find files in the current directory (recursively) that have the
filename "foo" AND that were created at least 0.1 days ago.

There is no support for arbitrary boolean combinations of filters like
in the real find.

Adding support for other file tests is easy, through modification
of the FileFilter class.

SETUP

The find tool requires ruby (it was tested successfully with 1.8.7 and
1.9.2). To run tests, rake is required. Because the program is not
packaged as a gem, it must be run from the root project directory.

USAGE

ruby ./find.rb path [BOOLEAN EXPRESSION]

where BOOLEAN EXPRESSION is valid combination of FILE FILTERS,
combined using the tokens AND, OR, NOT, (, and ). For example:

(name foo OR regex ^bar) AND ctime_min 0.1

FILE FILTERS

Currently the following filters are supported:

name - exact name match against the file name
regex - a (ruby-style) regex to match against the full file path
ctime_min - creation time minimum in days. e.g. "ctime_min 0.1" will
find files that are at least 0.1 days old.
ctime_max - creation time maximum in days.

TESTING

A Rakefile is provided to run the Test::Unit tests that live in the
test/ directory. To run them, run "rake" from the main directory. They
should all pass.

The tests use the subdir test/dummy_dir as the directory test
environment on which to execute.

POSSIBLE TODO:
-add more filters
-support for OR or even general boolean exprs
-use File.find?
-error checking (for main?)?
-tests for main?
